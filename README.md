SublimeLinter-jsl
=========================

This linter plugin for [SublimeLinter](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter3) provides an interface to [jsl (JavaScript Lint)](http://javascriptlint.com/index.htm). It will be used with files that have the “JavaScript” syntax, or within `<script>` tags in HTML files.

## Installation

### Linter installation
Before installing this plugin, you must ensure that `jsl` is installed on your system. To install `jsl`, download and run the appropriate installer from the [JavaScript Lint download page](http://javascriptlint.com/download.htm).

Now you can proceed to install the SublimeLinter-jsl plugin.

### Plugin installation
Please use [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation) to install the linter plugin. This will ensure that the plugin will be updated when new versions are available. If you want to install from source so you can modify the source code, you probably know what you are doing so we won’t cover that here.

To install via Package Control, do the following:

1. Within Sublime Text, bring up the [Command Palette](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/sublime-text-3/extensibility/command_palette.html) and type `install`. Among the commands you should see `Package Control: Install Package`. If that command is not highlighted, use the keyboard or mouse to select it. There will be a pause of a few seconds while Package Control fetches the list of available plugins.

1. When the plugin list appears, type `jsl`. Among the entries you should see `SublimeLinter-jsl`. If that entry is not highlighted, use the keyboard or mouse to select it.

## Settings
For general information on how SublimeLinter works with settings, please see [Settings](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter.github.io/wiki/Settings). For information on generic linter settings, please see [Linter Settings](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter.github.io/wiki/Linter-Settings).

You can configure `jsl` options by creating a `jsl` config file and setting the `"conf"` setting to point to that file. To create a `jsl` config file, type the following in a terminal:

```
jsl -help:conf > jsl.conf
```

1. Fork the plugin repository.
